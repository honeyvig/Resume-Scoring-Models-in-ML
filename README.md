# Resume-Scoring-Models-in-ML
 create models using SageMaker Notebooks that will evaluate resumes for plagiarism and relevancy. The ideal candidate should be proficient in machine learning and have experience with natural language processing. You'll be responsible for designing, implementing, and testing the models while ensuring accuracy in scoring. If you have a passion for data science and a keen eye for detail, we want to hear from you.

For more context:
- We currently already have a notebook with 2 scripts; one returns a plagiarism score and the other returns a relevance score
- The plagiarism score script doesn't need much work. The results are ok. We have an S3 bucket with a collection of plagiarized resumes that we use to compare the embendings.
- The relevance score using openAI and prompt engineering. The goal here will be to explore which model returns accurate results while not costing too much.
- Being able to fine tune a base model is a big plus
- We need to be able to deploy and use the models
====================
To create models for evaluating resumes for plagiarism and relevancy using Amazon SageMaker Notebooks, we'll follow the steps below. Since you already have scripts for plagiarism and relevance scoring, the goal is to refine and extend these scripts and deploy them for real-world use. We'll use SageMaker's features to fine-tune, test, and deploy models efficiently.
1. Setting Up the Environment

Before diving into model creation, we need to set up our environment on SageMaker. Ensure you have the appropriate permissions and access to the SageMaker Notebooks, S3 Bucket, and IAM roles.

    Create a SageMaker Notebook Instance:
        Log in to the AWS Management Console.
        Navigate to Amazon SageMaker > Notebook Instances > Create notebook instance.
        Choose an instance type (e.g., ml.t2.medium for testing purposes).
        Attach an IAM role that has access to the S3 bucket where your resumes are stored.

    Set Up Necessary Libraries: Within the notebook, make sure you have installed the required libraries:

    !pip install sagemaker transformers boto3 openai

2. Plagiarism Score Model

Since you already have a script that returns a plagiarism score, we can optimize and integrate it into SageMaker.

Current Approach:

    Embedding Comparison: You are using S3 to store plagiarized resumes and comparing the embeddings of the candidate's resume with a dataset of plagiarized resumes.

Improvement:

    You could fine-tune an existing model for text similarity or use Amazon Comprehend to further analyze document similarity.

Steps:

    Load your existing script that uses S3 for storing resumes.
    Convert it to a SageMaker-compatible model that can accept input from users and return a plagiarism score.
    Example code to calculate the cosine similarity between resume embeddings:

import boto3
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
import numpy as np

# Load S3 bucket with plagiarized resumes
s3 = boto3.client('s3')
bucket_name = 'your-bucket-name'

def get_resume_from_s3(file_key):
    response = s3.get_object(Bucket=bucket_name, Key=file_key)
    return response['Body'].read().decode('utf-8')

def calculate_cosine_similarity(resume_text, plagiarized_resume_text):
    vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
    vectors = vectorizer.fit_transform([resume_text, plagiarized_resume_text])
    return cosine_similarity(vectors[0], vectors[1])[0][0]

3. Relevance Score Model Using OpenAI and Prompt Engineering

Youâ€™ll use OpenAI (e.g., GPT) for calculating relevance scores based on a custom prompt. Fine-tuning may be needed to adjust results.

Steps:

    Create a Fine-Tuning Dataset: Collect a set of resumes along with labeled relevance scores (for training purposes). This data can be used to fine-tune the model.

    Example of a relevance score calculation prompt:

import openai

openai.api_key = 'your-api-key'

def get_relevance_score(resume_text, job_description):
    prompt = f"Evaluate the relevance of the following resume for the given job description:\n\nResume: {resume_text}\n\nJob Description: {job_description}\n\nRelevance Score:"
    
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="davinci-codex", 
        prompt=prompt, 
        max_tokens=100,
        n=1,
        stop=None,
        temperature=0.7
    )
    
    return response.choices[0].text.strip()

Fine-tuning: You can fine-tune models like GPT-3 or Codex on specific tasks such as evaluating resumes. You can gather labeled data from your previous analysis of resumes and job descriptions.

Example code for fine-tuning with OpenAI:

    openai.api_key = "your-api-key"

    # Prepare your dataset
    fine_tune_data = [
        {"prompt": "Resume 1 description", "completion": "Relevance: 8/10"},
        {"prompt": "Resume 2 description", "completion": "Relevance: 7/10"},
        # more data...
    ]

    # Fine-tune the model
    openai.FineTune.create(training_file=fine_tune_data)

4. Model Deployment and Testing

Once the models are fine-tuned, it's time to deploy them for real-time predictions.

Steps for Deployment:

    Create a SageMaker Model:
        Use SageMaker's pre-built containers for OpenAI models or custom models.
        Deploy the plagiarism and relevance models as endpoints in SageMaker.

Example deployment code:

import sagemaker
from sagemaker import get_execution_role

role = get_execution_role()

# Deploy the model to SageMaker
predictor = model.deploy(instance_type='ml.m5.large', initial_instance_count=1)

    Test Your Endpoint: Once deployed, you can use the model to get predictions.

result = predictor.predict({
    "resume_text": "Resume content here",
    "job_description": "Job description here"
})

print(result)

    API Endpoint: Use SageMaker or a serverless option like AWS Lambda to call the model via HTTP requests.

5. Create API for Resume Evaluation:

Once you have the models deployed, create an API using Flask or FastAPI to serve the functionality of both plagiarism and relevance scoring.
6. Monitor & Improve Models:

    Use SageMaker's Model Monitor to check the performance and accuracy of the models over time.
    Continue fine-tuning based on feedback from the application or additional data.

Conclusion:

This system should effectively allow you to:

    Evaluate plagiarism and relevance scores for resumes.
    Deploy both models (plagiarism and relevance) using AWS SageMaker.
    Ensure scalability, efficiency, and accuracy while minimizing costs by using OpenAI models and SageMaker endpoints.

By following this workflow, you'll create a robust, scalable solution for evaluating resumes with accurate plagiarism and relevance scoring, suitable for deployment in production.
